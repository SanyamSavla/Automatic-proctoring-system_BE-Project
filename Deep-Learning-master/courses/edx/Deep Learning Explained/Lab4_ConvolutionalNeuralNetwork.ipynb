    "# Lab 4 - Convolutional Neural Network with MNIST\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab corresponds to Module 4 of the \"Deep Learning Explained\" course. We assume that you have successfully Lab 1 to download the MNIST data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on MNIST data. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "A [convolutional neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) (CNN, or ConvNet) is a type of [feed-forward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedforward_neural_network) artificial neural network made up of neurons that have learnable weights and biases, very similar to ordinary multi-layer perceptron (MLP) networks introduced in Module 3. The CNNs take advantage of the spatial nature of the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "In nature, we perceive different objects by their shapes, size and colors. For example, objects in a natural scene are typically composed of edges, corners/vertices (defined by two of more edges), color patches etc. These primitives are often identified using different detectors (e.g., edge detection, color detector) or combination of detectors interacting to facilitate image interpretation (object classification, region of interest detection, scene description etc.) in real world vision related tasks. These detectors are also known as filters. \n",
    "\n",
    "Convolution is a mathematical operator that takes an image and a filter as input and produces a filtered output (representing say egdges, corners, colors etc in the input image).  Historically, these filters are a set of weights that were often hand crafted or modeled with mathematical functions (e.g., [Gaussian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_filter) / [Laplacian](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/log.htm) / [Canny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canny_edge_detector) filter).  The filter outputs are mapped through non-linear activation functions mimicking human brain cells called [neurons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron).\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolutional networks provide a machinery to learn these filters from the data directly instead of explicit mathematical models and have been found to be superior (in real world tasks) compared to historically crafted filters.  With convolutional networks, the focus is on learning the filter weights instead of learning individually fully connected pair-wise (between inputs and outputs) weights. In this way, the number of weights to learn is reduced when compared with the traditional MLP networks from the previous tutorials.  In a convolutional network, one learns several filters ranging in number from single digits to thousands depending on the network complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the CNN primitives have been shown to have a conceptually parallel components in brain's [visual cortex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_cortex). A neuron in the visual cortex will emit responses when a certain region of its input cells are stimulated. This region is known as the receptive field (RF) of the neuron. \n",
    "\n",
    "Equivalently, in a convolution layer, the input region corresponding to the filter dimensions at certain locations in the input layer can be considered as the receptive field of the nodes in the convolutional layer. Popular deep CNNs or ConvNets (such as [AlexNet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlexNet), [VGG](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556), [Inception](http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2015/papers/Szegedy_Going_Deeper_With_2015_CVPR_paper.pdf), [ResNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385v1.pdf)) that are used for various [computer vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision) tasks have many of these architectural primitives (inspired from biology).  \n",
    "\n",
    "We will introduce the convolution operation and gain familiarity with the different parameters in CNNs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**:\n",
    "We will continue to work on the same problem of recognizing digits in MNIST data. The MNIST data comprises of hand-written digits with little background noise."

    "The first model we build is a simple convolution only network. Here we have two convolutional layers. Since, our task is to detect the 10 digits in the MNIST database, the output of the network should be a vector of length 10, 1 element corresponding to each output class. This is achieved by projecting the output of the last convolutional layer using a dense layer with the output being `num_output_classes`. We have seen this before with Logistic Regression and MLP where features were mapped to the number of classes in the final layer. Also, note that since we will be using the `softmax` operation that is combined with the `cross entropy` loss function during training (see a few cells below), the final dense layer has no activation function associated with it.\n",

Increasing the filter shape leads to an increase in the number of model parameters, increases the compute time and helps the model better fit to the data. However, one runs the risk of [overfitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting). Typically, the number of filters in the deeper layers are more than the number of filters in the layers before them. We have chosen 8, 16 for the first and second layers, respectively. These hyperparameters should be experimented with during model building.\n",

    "Often times, one needs to control the number of parameters especially when having deep networks. For every layer of the convolution layer output (each layer, corresponds to the output of a filter), one can have a pooling layer. Pooling layers are typically introduced to:\n",
    "- Reduce the shape of the current layer (speeding up the network),\n",
    "- Make the model more tolerant to changes in object location in the image. For example, even when a digit is shifted to one side of the image instead of being in the middle, the classifer would perform the classification task well.\n",

    "The calculation on a pooling node is much simpler than a normal feedforward node.  It has no weight, bias, or activation function.  It uses a simple aggregation function (like max or average) to compute its output.  The most commonly used function is \"max\" - a max pooling node simply outputs the maximum of the input values corresponding to the filter position of the input. The figure below shows the input values in a 4 x 4 region. The max pooling window size is 2 x 2 and starts from the top left corner, and uses a stride of 2x2.  The maximum value within the window becomes the output of the region. Every time the model is shifted by the amount specified by the stride parameter (as shown in the figure below) and the maximum pooling operation is repeated. \n",
